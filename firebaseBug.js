The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the provided data is invalid or if there's a problem with your Firebase configuration. For instance, using an incorrect data type or attempting to write data to a path that's not allowed by your security rules could result in an unexpected error.  Another common issue is exceeding the maximum size limits for documents or collections.  These errors can be tricky to track down because error messages might not always be very specific.
