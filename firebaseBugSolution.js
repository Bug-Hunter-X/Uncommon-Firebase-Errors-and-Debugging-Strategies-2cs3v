The solutions often involve robust data validation before sending data to Firebase.  Always check data types and formats. Implement comprehensive error handling using `try...catch` blocks to gracefully handle exceptions from Firebase. Use the Firebase console to monitor storage usage and ensure you're not exceeding limits.  If dealing with asynchronous operations, use promises or async/await to handle potential race conditions or timing issues.  Carefully review and adjust your Firebase security rules to prevent unauthorized access or data modification. Examine the Firebase console logs for specific error messages and details.
